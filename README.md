Cheshire Scripts
======================

A small collection of scripts that I've written to use with Cheshire. Please feel free to add to them. They're all very mundane but the reactions aren't.

The reddit_links.py script generates an applescript that opens up X number of windows from a subreddit of your choice. Will give you 25 r/aww links by default.

Best way to use it (on os x):

    # Outputs directly to your clipboard
    python reddit_links.py <subreddit> <# links>
    cat <subreddit>_<# links> | pbcopy
